<div class="description">
  <p>Started learning about Cyber Security during highschool. My highschool was a trade school and a had a Computer Science/Cyber Security program. From that program,
  it help guide my passion of being an engineer. I enjoy understanding how computers work, breaking hardware and software down and repairing it, and repurposing them for something else that
  they weren't initialy designed to do. The program also help me acquire CompTIA Security + Certification</p>
  <p>During college at Towson University, I engage and perfected my craft through courses, helpful professors, and the Towson Cyber Defense Club (TCDC). TCDC was crucial for
    me to find like-minded people who where passonate in cyber and also hel pguide me to the right path of where I wanted to be in my career which is to be a security engineer.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I read up and configure new projects, participate in cyber competitions, write guides to breakdown and understand software, make videos, and fitness.</p>
