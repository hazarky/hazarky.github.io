  <p>Projects are where my usual free time is spent. Primiarly my projects come from ideas/problems that I want to resolve in my home lab. My first major project in Highschool
    involving computer science was testing the viability of a decade old hardware that has been marginally upgraded to do modern tasks. The project was successful</p>
  <p> Other Projects that I worked on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Repurposing a landfill desktop into a self-hosted modern file-server</li>
      <li>Automating tasks like pushing configurations to Cisco routers and switches with python.</li>
